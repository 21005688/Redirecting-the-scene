# Redirecting-the-scene

To Redirect the scene in the unity engine.

## Algorithm:
# Step 1 :
Create a new 3D scene in the unity and save it as Level1.

# Step 2 :
From the Hierarchy , select a plane , cube and a sphere and place in the scene. Scale of plane is (4,1,4) .Scale of Cube is (2,1,2).Scale of sphere is (1,1,1).

# Step 3 :
Right Click on Assets , choose material and give color to your cube and sphere.

# Step 4 :
Add rigid body component to cube and sphere.

# Step 5 :
Select the sphere, in the inspector - select tag and add a new tag named "cube".And tag the cube in sphere inspector.

# Step 6 :
From File , create another scene and name that scene as "Level2".

# Step 7 :
Create a C# file named Prog and type the code required to redirecting the scene. And Add the C# file to the cube.

# Step 8 :
From File, select Build settings and add open scene.Both the scene should be added.

# Step 9 :
From Hierarchy , Select text and type " YOU WON ", and uncheck the text in inspector.

# Step 10 :
Slect the cube inspector , add the text object in the WinText feild under the C# file.

# Step 11 :
Compile and run the program, as a result when the sphere falls on the cube ,it gets disappeared and the text message will pop up on the scene . On clicking "R",the level1 scene will be redirected to Level2 scene.

# Result:
Thus redirecting a scene is done successfully in the unity engine.
